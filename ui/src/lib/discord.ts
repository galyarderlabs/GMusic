/**
 * The Discord Rich Presence card layout, as the settings tab edits it and `DiscordCard.svelte`
 * previews it.
 *
 * This is the TypeScript half of `src-tauri/src/discord.rs`: the same field names, the same string
 * values, the same defaults, and the same rules for which slot resolves to what. It is persisted as
 * one JSON blob in the `discord_rpc_config` setting rather than a settings row per knob, so adding
 * an option means a field here, a field there, and a control in the tab.
 *
 * The two copies of `cardText`/`cardLink` have to agree or the preview lies about what the user's
 * friends will see. Change one, change the other.
